# HWS Creative Scenario

## Info

HWS Configs have the goal to enrich the Multiplayer gaming experience for the [HWS Servers](https://empyrion-homeworld.net), because the Vanilla Config files have the focus on Singleplayer. 
It concentrates heavily on performance and fun, hence some values may differ from Vanilla.

I value feedback, so the Config files are constantly changing based on the Community interaction with them.

The main intention for this repository is for HWS players to test and work with the HWS Configs for HWS.

Other Server Owners may use my HWS Configs by giving proper credit.

### Effectiveness Weapon System (EWS)

HWS uses a detailed Rock-Paper-Scissors principle for Weapons and Materials. A spreadsheet about it can be found here:

## Setup

1. [Download the master zip](https://github.com/B-iggy/HWS-Configs/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the files
3. Put the files in Content/Configuration or in your Content/Scenarios/YourScenario/Content/Configuration
4. Restart your game or reload your savegame or rejoin the server

**WARNING:** This will overwrite the Vanilla Configuration and with that the Vanilla game experience! Make backups of your Vanilla Config files.
HWS Config files can cause errors or crashes at any time.
*If this happen you can also create an ["Issue"](https://github.com/B-iggy/HWS-Configs/issues) and let me know what went wrong*
