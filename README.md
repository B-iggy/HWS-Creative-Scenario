# HWS Creative Scenario

## Info

HWS Configs have the goal to enrich the Multiplayer gaming experience for the [HWS Servers](https://empyrion-homeworld.net), because the Vanilla Config files have the focus on Singleplayer. 
It concentrates heavily on performance and fun, hence some values may differ from Vanilla.

I value feedback, so the Config files are constantly changing based on the Community interaction with them.

The main intention for this repository is for HWS players to test and work with the HWS Configs for HWS - in form of an easy to use Scenario.

Other Server Owners may use my HWS Configs by giving proper credit! (hence I removed the Github LICENCE for now. [Read more about it here:](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/))
Especially the use of my own custom created content (hwsmodels in SharedData/Content/Bundles) needs explicit permission from me!

### Effectiveness Weapon System (EWS)

HWS uses a detailed Rock-Paper-Scissors principle for Weapons and Materials. A spreadsheet about it can be found here:
